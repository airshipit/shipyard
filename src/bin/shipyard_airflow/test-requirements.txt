# Had to upgrade apache-airflow as 1.10.1 requires a version of jinja too old

# install postgres seperately as apache-airflow 1.10.2 forces postgres to use
# psycopg2 instead of psycopg2-binary which requires additional apt packages
# to be installed, i.e. postgres-devel. Otherwise the following error is seen:
# Error: pg_config executable not found. Only seems to be an issue in xenial
