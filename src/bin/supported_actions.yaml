# This file contains a list of supported actions that exists outside the
# scope of both the client and API. This is tested in both the client and
# the API to ensure that the actions in the API match the actions supported
# in the help of the client. Because of this, it becomes another place that
# has to be updated, but since it's tied to tests, the reminders to fix it
# should be outweighed by the benefit.

  - deploy_site
  - update_site
