Multiple Distro Support
=======================

This project builds images for Shipyard and Airflow components. Currently, it
supports building images for ubuntu and opensuse ( leap 15.1 as base image).

By default, Ubuntu images are built and are published to public registry
server. Recently support for publishing opensuse image has also been added.

If you need to build opensuse images locally, the following parameters
can be passed to the *make* command in shipyard repository's root
directory with *images* as target::

    DISTRO: opensuse_15
    DISTRO_BASE_IMAGE: "opensuse/leap:15.1"
    DOCKER_REGISTRY: { your_docker_registry }
    IMAGE_TAG: latest
    IMAGE_NAME: airflow
    PUSH_IMAGE: false

Following is an example in command format to build and publish images locally.
Command is run in shipyard repository's root directory.

    DISTRO=opensuse_15 DOCKER_REGISTRY={ your_docker_registry } \
    IMAGE_NAME=airflow IMAGE_TAG=latest PUSH_IMAGE=true make images


Following parameters need to be passed as environment/shell variable to make
command:

DISTRO
  parameter to identify distro specific Dockerfile, ubuntu_jammy (Default)

DISTRO_BASE_IMAGE
  parameter to use different base image other than what's used in DISTRO
  specific Dockerfile (optional)

DOCKER_REGISTRY
  parameter to specify local/internal docker registry if need
  to publish image (optional), quay.io (Default)

IMAGE_TAG
  tag to be used for image built, untagged (Default)

PUSH_IMAGE
  flag to indicate if images needs to be pushed to a docker
  registry, false (Default)


This work is done as per approved spec `multi_distro_support`_. Currently only image
building logic is enhanced to support multiple distro.


Adding New Distro Support
--------------------------

To add support for building images for a new distro, following steps can be
followed.

  #. Shipyard uses images for shipyard and airflow. So to build images for those
     components, two Dockerfiles are required, one for each component.

  #. Add distro specific Dockerfile for each component which will have steps to include
     necessary packages and run environment configuration. Use existing Dockerfile as
     sample to identify needed packages and environment information.

  #. New dockerfile can be named as Dockefile.{DISTRO} where DISTRO is expected to be
     distro identifier which is passed to makefile.

  #. Respective dockerfile should be placed in {shipyard_root}/images/airflow and
     {shipyard_root}/images/shipyard

  #. Add check, gate, and post jobs for building, testing and publishing images. These
     entries need to be added in {shipyard_root}/.zuul.yaml file. Please refer to
     existing zuul file for better existing opensuse support.

  #. Add any relevant information to this document.
